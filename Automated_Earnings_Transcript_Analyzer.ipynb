            "    - And we have seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB and Wealth Management business.\n",
            "    - Revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year-on-year.\n",
            "    - And Markets revenue was down $400 million or 5% year-on-year.\n",
            "    - Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year-on-year driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the increase to the FDIC special assessment.\n",
            "    - On to balance sheet and capital on Page 3.\n",
            "    - While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances were still above pre-pandemic levels, and wages are keeping pace with inflation.\n",
            "    - Client investment assets were up 25% year-on-year driven by market performance and strong net inflows.\n",
            "    - In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue.\n",
            "    - Total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year-on-year.\n",
            "    - Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year.\n",
            "    - Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher noninterest revenue.\n",
            "    - Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year-on-year predominantly driven by higher compensation, reflecting an increase in employees, including for office and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expenses.\n",
            "    - Average deposits were down 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting seasonally lower balances.\n",
            "    - Loans were flat quarter-on-quarter.\n",
            "    - And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continue to have an impact on originations and sales activity.\n",
            "    - Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7.\n",
            "    - Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year-on-year.\n",
            "    - Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5% driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin compression.\n",
            "    - And client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year-on-year driven by higher market levels and continued net inflow.\n",
            "    - Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year-on-year.\n",

            "    - We're continuing to buy back stock at $2 billion a year.\n",
            "    - So you may see us do things in the short run that will increase earnings, increase capital -- that are using up that capital.\n",
            "    - I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess capital is not wasted capital, it's earnings in store.\n",
            "    - James Mitchell:Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change?\n",
            "    - So as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend that is driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise.\n",
            "    - And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII.\n",
            "    - Is it balances?\n",
            "    - We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down.\n",
            "    - Yes, we still expect 12% card loan growth for the full year.\n",
            "    - Businesses are in good shape.\n",
            "    - And other financial assets.\n",
            "    - So obviously, one major area is that we're overearning in deposit margins, especially in consumer.\n",
            "    - And that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid.\n",
            "    - One, let's focus on NII ex, not on total NII.\n",
            "    - And we've got other factors, we've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n",
            "    - And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period.\n",
            "    - We're engaging with clients.\n",
            "    - You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do.\n",
            "    - Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other things.\n",
            "    - So there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline.\n",
            "    - Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies.\n",
            "    - And I think, to get to the heart of your question, which is, okay, in what type of environment would we make different strategic questions?\n",
            "    - I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged, simply because of the business cycle in the short term.\n",
            "    - Matthew O'Connor:You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet.\n",
            "    - Any trends within that, that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category -- either overall or among certain segments?Jeremy Barnum:Maybe a little bit.\n",
            "    - But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal post-pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets.\n",
            "    - And that's sort of at the margin good news from a credit perspective.\n",
            "    - That, I think, has manifested itself a little bit in the leveraged lending space in the normal way that it does in that there's a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool.\n",
            "    - We've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies.\n",

            "    - Then to complete our lines-of-business, AWM on Page 6.\n",
            "    - Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression.\n",
            "    - Expenses of $3.5 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams.\n",
            "    - And client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows.\n",
            "    - So to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income.\n",
            "    - So given all that, putting it all together I'm sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital.\n",
            "    - Maybe just for my follow-up on NII.\n",
            "    - Deposit balances were also more resilient in what's a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth.\n",
            "    - So just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating.\n",
            "    - So let's talk about deposit balances.\n",
            "    - Loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that.\n",
            "    - Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question.\n",
            "    - Jeremy, great to see the progress on investment banking fees, up sequentially and 50% year-over-year.\n",
            "    - So on private credit, so nothing really new to say there.\n",
            "    - But I guess I would just caution you from -- a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet, and concluding that when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front.\n",
            "    - And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs?\n",
            "    - And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very supplemental model of the company, you would have like expenses grow -- revenue is growing at some organic GDP like rate, maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio.\n",
            "    - But the pieces of that or the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin.\n",
            "    - Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the over earning narrative.\n",
            "    - And now you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here.\n",
            "    - Gerard Cassidy:Jeremy, can you -- I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question.\n",
            "    - I noticed on the average balances, the non-interest bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they have steadily declined.\n",
            "    - And this is one of the areas, of course investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers.\n",
            "    - Can you elaborate, if you can, what you're seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account?\n",
            "    - I have to be honest, I haven't focused on that particular sequential explain i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits.\n",
            "    - I mean how are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment, and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits.\n",
            "    - Sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business.\n",
            "    - One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been for -- in this elevated rate environment.\n",
            "    - And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans.\n",
            "    - Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital.\n",
            "    - And then secondly outside of Cards, loan demand has been quite weak.\n",
            "    - And any thoughts from you on if you're seeing any change in demand or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward?\n",
            "    - On the loan demand front, yes, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand.\n",
            "    - So whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts, and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth that's going to make sense.\n",
            "    - And of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we are going to do is have the excess capital mean that we lean in to lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure.\n",
            "    - So there is always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally.\n",

            "    - Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 and revenue of $43.3 billion with an ROTCE of 19%.\n",
            "    - In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year.\n",
            "    - In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows.\n",
            "    - The firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year-on-year.\n",
            "    - Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by compensation including revenue related compensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense.\n",
            "    - On to balance sheet and capital on page three.\n",
            "    - In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue.\n",
            "    - Average deposits were down 8% year-on-year and 2% sequentially.\n",
            "    - We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield seeking activity including CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year.\n",
            "    - Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network.\n",
            "    - In home lending, revenue was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher NII partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue.\n",
            "    - Revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII on higher revolving balances.\n",
            "    - Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing.\n",
            "    - Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression.\n",
            "    - Moving to markets, total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year.\n",
            "    - Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes.\n",
            "    - Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially.\n",
            "    - In multifamily, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near-term as originations are offset by payoff activity.\n",
            "    - Average client deposits were up 7% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and security services.\n",
            "    - Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page six.\n",
            "    - For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin compression.\n",
            "    - Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense.\n",
            "    - AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows.\n",
            "    - And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter-on-quarter.\n",
            "    - Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year-on-year.\n",
            "    - So can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline, including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut?\n",
            "    - And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending another cash buffers.\n",
            "    - So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances.\n",
            "    - And when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of Q2 will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances.\n",
            "    - The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year, so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization.\n",
            "    - The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year.\n",
            "    - Like the strategy hasn't changed.\n",
            "    - The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had.\n",
            "    - So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and NII next quarter, but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now\n",
            "    - You call expenses very often.\n",
            "    - I call investments.\n",
            "    - We're adding ETF in asset wealth management.\n",
            "    - We're growing chase wealth management.\n",
            "    - We think there are huge opportunities in the innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technologies, stuff like that.\n",
            "    - Our goal is to gain share, and everything we do, we get really good returns on it.\n",
            "    - These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on.\n",
            "    - Just a quick follow-up from me just drilling down into NII.\n",
            "    - We have the capacity inside the portfolio.\n",
            "    - Erika Najarian:My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up.\n",
            "    - And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas are -- have -- in actuality, even lower than the modeled deposit beta.\n",
            "    - They care about your return on equity.\n",
            "    - Different, different countries, different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and MSP, I want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that.\n",
            "    - And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capital.\n",
            "    - Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world.\n",
            "    - We've seen limited loan growth for a few years now, market-related also.\n",
            "    - And so first and foremost -- I'm going to talk about very strategic\n",
            "    - Therefore, when a client comes in, we will offer them both direct lending on ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending.\n",
            "    - We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans.\n",
            "    - Again, all in the service of the client and making sure what we're offering them are the best thing.\n",
            "    - And we're going to different strategy.\n",
            "    - That's our strategy.\n",
            "    - We are going to do what's right for the client.\n",
            "    - Remember, when we do business with the client, we also get other revenues often.\n",
            "    - So it isn't just the loan, we look at the whole relationship.\n",
            "    - Now I would just give you the minimum excess capital.\n",
            "    - Average loan is $1.3 trillion.\n",
            "    - I know you're going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.\n",
            "    - Loans are an outcome of doing good business.\n",
            "    - And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right?\n",
            "    - And that could include loans that are almost good loans on a standalone basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship where we're getting other revenue as part of that.\n",
            "    - So it's the same strategy that we've always had.\n",
            "    - So lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines.\n",
            "    - Now those firms are many cases, also clients.\n",
            "    - We're going to deploy more capital we want.\n",
            "    - And that's one of the reasons that we feel that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level.\n",
            "    - In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular that there's a bunch of different offsetting factors right now, right?\n",
            "    - And so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex-Markets, could you...Jeremy Barnum:Those were core NII or NII ex.\n",
            "    - So I mean always say, assets acquisitions.\n",
            "    - That -- if our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course, we want to do more.\n",
            "    - I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in '25, but I did want to delve into the -- how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years?\n",
            "    - You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so put some pressure on deposit NII.\n",
            "    - But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve is now has been going.\n",
            "    - I guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits?\n",
            "    - So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pulls of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit -- the value of the deposit franchise.\n",
            "    - And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high.\n",
            "    - Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e., growth in the CD mix and/or we would see a lower policy rate.\n",
            "    - So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment, looking at what the environment is for deposits.\n",
            "    - Other than that, if you look at -- if you were going to say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money, that happens.\n",
            "    - Jamie Dimon:Very good returns in business in Banking & Wealth Management.\n",
            "    - We're growing market share.\n",
